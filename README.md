Trading Simulation is a new module in Nasdaq for users which are new to stock market and trading to learn how investment works. Users can create stock trading games with custom settings such as different starting balance, duration of the game, interest rate, etc. At the end of each game session, users will get their experience based on the profit they earned and represented as levels of their game account. Nasdaq will also give its own profit value and revenue calculated by its own algorithms to show the users how they can maximize their profit in real life if they buy our services, which can potentially bring more customers to Nasdaq.
